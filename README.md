# OCR-RECEIPT
Cooper Lyon and Gregory Finnegan: Application where user can scan receipts with OCR.
Our source for this project is https://github.com/mre/receipt-parser
The repository that we used had a good base of code for an OCR Scanner. 
We are going to try to fix the code from this repository and if unsuccesful write our own code.
